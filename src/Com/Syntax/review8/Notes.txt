Overriding - process when same method exist in super and subclass
Why - to provide flexibility
How to implement
1. Inheritance
2. same signature (name+parameters)
3. same return type
4. access modifiers -> overriding method must have same level of visibility or higher

Polymorphism allows us to perform same action in different ways. There are two types of
Polymorphism: early binding or compile time and time runtime or late binding.
Polymorphism that is achieved with the help of method overloading is called early
binding or compile time Polymorphism. When we achieve the polymorphism with the
help of method overriding it is called run time Polymorphism.
